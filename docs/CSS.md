#### Format for _Reading CSS_

Use the following format for your own "Reading CSS" file: `docs/CSS.md`. 
Please note the many values for each property and be sure to denote the default value. 
Also be sure to include `inherit` as a value and whether the property is inherited by 
default. What does that mean, anyway?
