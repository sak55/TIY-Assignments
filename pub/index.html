        <h1>Demo Day!</h1>
        <em>By Susanna Miller, Campus Director</em>
        <p>Hard to believe, but the Front End Cohort has completed their 12 weeks at The Iron Yard! Demo Day, last Friday, wrapped up the cohort in style. With over 50 people in attendance, seats in the Melrose Center filled up quickly! </p>

    <p>There were four student presentations of the team capstone projects completed during the final three weeks of the course - stay tuned for updates on the projects, and links! </p>

    <p>Student presentations were followed by Q&A with student teams, and a happy hour down the street. Want to make sure you can make it to the next Demo Day? Join our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/The-Iron-Yard-Orlando/">Meetup group</a>!</p>

        <h1>Demo Day is Around the Corner!</h1>
        <em>By Susanna Miller, Campus Director</em>
        <p>The title here begs the question: what is Demo Day? At its most basic, Demo Day is a showcase for our students - a chance to demonstrate what they’ve spend 12 weeks immersed in. Students will be presenting the applicants they pitched and voted on, à la Startup Weekend, and then created with sweat (and possibly a few tears) over the final three weeks of The Iron Yard program.</p>
        <p>Demo Day is also a great way to find out more about The Iron Yard, and meet the graduates and instructors in an informal setting. The Iron Yard Orlando’s Demo Day is less than two weeks away, and will be held in the state-of-the-art Melrose Center at the Downtown Public Library; we’re delighted to be able to use that awesome space to show off the talents and hard work of our skilled front end engineers!</p>

        <h1>Capstone Projects Starting at The Iron Yard Orlando</h1>
        <em>By Susanna Miller, Campus Director</em>
        <p>This week, the Front End Engineering students at The Iron Yard started started their capstone projects - and started moving into the next stage of their experience at the Orlando Academy. In Orlando, we’ve focused on group projects, so that the capstone is not only about writing code and creating a final product, but also about teamwork.</p>
        <p>We started with project pitches by our students, which were then voted upon. The instructors and I picked the most viable projects, taking into consideration their popularity with students, breadth of knowledge required, and technical difficulty. Then, continuing to follow the startup weekend model, students went on to form teams of 2-3.</p>
        <p>That we’re going into the Thanksgiving weekend affects workflow, of course, but one of the best things I’ve seen so far at The Iron Yard was watching the students come in this morning, excited about their projects, and with user stories and initial work already done. Recognizing how far they’ve already come from when they started the course is one of the most rewarding aspects of The Iron Yard, from a staff side, and as we finish prepping for our Demo Day (more info about that <a href="http://www.meetup.com/The-Iron-Yard-Orlando/events/218912707/">here</a>!), I can’t wait to see what these look like when they’re finished!</p>
